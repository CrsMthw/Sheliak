/**
 * The ONE top app bar every **detail** surface uses — album, artist, playlist, the player and queue
 * placeholders — in single-pane, in a two-pane card, and in their loading / error states. Lay it
 * over the screen's own scrolling content (`align(TopCenter)`, composed LAST so it draws and
 * hit-tests above the rows); it is never a `Scaffold` `topBar` (it must overlap the hero, and in
 * two-pane it belongs to one pane only).
 *
 * ### It is SOLID, and it is the pane's own colour
 *
 * [paneColor] goes into **both** colour slots — `background` single-pane, the Card's `surface` in a
 * two-pane card — so the bar simply *is* the pane: no band at rest, none scrolled, and none on
 * AMOLED (the theme forces `background`/`surface` to black; `surfaceContainer`, M3's default
 * `scrolledContainerColor`, is NOT flattened — never use it here).
 *
 * Never pass `Color.Transparent` as the resting colour: it is `0x00000000`, i.e. BLACK at zero
 * alpha, and `SingleRowTopAppBar` thresholds its scrolled fraction to a binary 0/1 and hands it to
 * an `animateColorAsState` that lerps in RGBA — so for the length of that spec the container passes
 * through *translucent black*, a grey flash over the page in BOTH scroll directions. At rest a
 * transparent bar is indistinguishable from a solid one anyway, because behind it there is only
 * page background.
 *
 * ### No `scrollBehavior`, deliberately
 *
 * With both colour slots equal there is nothing for a behaviour to drive, and a null behaviour is
 * the cheapest of the options: `overlappedFraction` is never consulted, `scrolledOffset` resolves to
 * `0f`, `adjustHeightOffsetLimit` is a no-op, and no `appBarDragModifier` is installed. The one
 * thing we *do* want is unconditional — the bar's root `Box` ends in `.pointerInput(Unit) {}`, so the
 * bar consumes touches across its full bounds (and so pull-to-refresh and list drags must start
 * below it) whether or not a behaviour is passed. Callers therefore need no `Modifier.nestedScroll`
 * for this bar's sake.
 *
 * ### Hero clearance and the fade strip
 *
 * A detail screen's art hero (item 0 of its list) bakes its own top clearance onto the art tile:
 * `statusBarsPadding() + TopAppBarDefaults.TopAppBarExpandedHeight + 8.dp + [BarContentGap]`, i.e.
 * the bar's own collapsed height plus a small gap plus the app-wide gap under a bar. Add **nothing**
 * on top of that — no list `contentPadding` top inset (it doubles). A screen with no hero (a
 * placeholder body) pads its content by the same bar height instead.
 *
 * Pair the bar with [DetailTopBarFade], composed between the scrolling content and the bar, so the
 * first rows dissolve into the bar instead of sliding past its title.
 *
 * ### A contextual (selection) bar swaps the SLOTS, not the bar
 *
 * A multi-select bar is the standard M3 contextual action bar: ONE of these, always present and
 * always opaque, whose `navigationIcon` / `title` / `actions` each `Crossfade` on a hoisted
 * `updateTransition`. Never crossfade two whole bars — mid-fade both containers are partly
 * transparent, and 0.4 + 0.6 of [paneColor] does not composite to an opaque strip, so the rows show
 * through.
 *
 * @param paneColor the colour of whatever this bar sits on: the screen background, or the Card's
 *   colour in a two-pane card.
 * @param navigationIcon usually the back `IconButton` (debounced `onBack` + a `confirm()` haptic).
 * @param actions the screen's actions, as a `TopAppBar` `actions` row.
 * @param heroTitle the hero-title hand-off ([rememberHeroTitleHandoff], also handed to the screen's
 *   hero). Non-null fades [title] in as the hero title slides under this bar; null keeps [title]
 *   permanently visible (the two-pane hero panes, which pass no title at all).
 * @param title the bar title. It receives the alpha [Modifier] the hand-off drives — put it on the
 *   `Text`; ignore it for a title that must be visible regardless of the scroll position (a
 *   contextual bar's "N selected" count does exactly that, inside its own slot `Crossfade`).

 * edge and a top-anchored strip tracks the collapse for free.
 *
 * A detail bar is an overlay instead, so it needs the offset form — [DetailTopBarFade]. That is the
 * whole difference between the two; do not "unify" them into one.
 *
 * Compose it in the content `Box` AFTER the scrolling content, so it draws over the rows — the
 * [BottomFadeScrim] may follow it; they do not overlap. Where there is a `PullToRefreshBox`, put it
 * inside its CONTENT lambda: `PullToRefreshBox` emits `content(); indicator()`, so the strip draws
 * over the rows and the indicator still slides out over the strip. It is a plain background `Box`

 * Both ends are geometry, reported from layout and read from the draw phase:

 *  - [DetailTopBar] reads [barTitleAlpha] inside a `graphicsLayer` block. **Only** from there: the
