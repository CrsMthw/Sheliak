/**
 * Gap to leave above a fully-expanded modal bottom sheet — the **status-bar height**, so the sheet
 * stops right below the status bar rather than running edge-to-edge under it.
 *
 * Cap a sheet's scrollable content to the enclosing `BoxWithConstraints.maxHeight - sheetTopGap()`
 * so the sheet's measured height stays STRICTLY below the screen. The M3 sheet puts its Expanded
 * anchor at `(fullHeight - contentSize)`; when the content fills the screen exactly that anchor is at
 * offset 0, where the spring fling overshoots and bounces / wedges touch on the first pull-up — a
 * known M3 bug (https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/285847707). Any positive gap is bounce-safe;
 * the status-bar height just sets where the fully-expanded sheet stops. Falls back to 24.dp if the
 * inset reads 0 (e.g. an immersive/edge case) so the gap is never zero.

 * Why it exists: a modal sheet is its own window, so simply removing it from composition (nulling
 * the state that gates it) makes it *vanish* — there is no hide animation at all. The order M3
 * documents is the other way round: animate to `Hidden` first, leave composition once hidden. That
 * is what the scrim tap, the swipe-down and the back gesture already do internally.

     *
     * Only one hide is in flight at a time: without the latch a second tap during the animation
     * would queue a second [then] (two share choosers, two navigations). The latch is [isHiding].
     *
     * **Neither [then] nor `onDismissRequest` runs if the hide is cancelled** — both live INSIDE
     * the coroutine after `hide()` returns, and code after a cancellation point does not run. That
     * is deliberate: a cancelled hide means the sheet is still up, and a follow-up firing then
     * would act against (and clear) state the visible sheet still owns. If the user's own drag
     * carries the sheet on to Hidden, M3 fires the sheet's own `onDismissRequest` and [then] is

 *    hidden behind a half-height detent (which also snaps to a screen-relative position when it
 *    settles). Pair it with a content cap of `maxHeight - sheetTopGap()` on the single scrollable
 *    child to keep the sheet below the screen height — see [sheetTopGap].
 * 2. **Programmatic dismissal animates.** The content reaches [LocalSheetDismissal] to close the
 *    sheet the way the scrim tap / swipe-down / back gesture do — `hide()` first, leave composition
 *    after — instead of vanishing mid-air the moment the state gating it flips. Work that must
 *    follow the sheet being gone (navigation, a share chooser) goes in `dismiss(then = …)`.
